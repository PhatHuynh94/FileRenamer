# FileRenamer
Renames all files in a folder to a common name

This program is meant to be used via command line. 

There are two commands -name and -path:
-name is the common name for the files. Needs to be used while excuting program
-path is the folder directory. Does not need to be used while excuting program

if -path is not used the program will rename all files in the same folder as the program.

examples:

FileRename -name "Hello World"

FileRename -path C:\blah -name "Red Rocket"
